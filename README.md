## To Install

Runtime has no dependencies and is very small.
For types to work you need `typescript` and `type-fest`.

```bash
pnpm add openapi-builder-client
pnpm add -D typescript@^5.0.0 type-fest@^4.9.0
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
